# ClimateWins: Machine Learning for Predicting Climate Change Impacts üåç
## Project Overview
Welcome to the ClimateWins project! This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for using machine learning to analyze weather data and predict climate change impacts in Europe. 

This project explores:

How machine learning can predict extreme weather events and climate conditions. 
Historical analysis of temperature extremes in Europe from 18 weather stations. 
Ethical considerations and best practices in applying AI to climate studies. 
## Key Objectives
Understand machine learning applications for weather and climate data. 
Explore supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for predictive analysis. 
Use historical weather data to identify trends and predict conditions. 
Deliver actionable insights to ClimateWins for strategic planning.

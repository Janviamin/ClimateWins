# ClimateWins: Machine Learning for Predicting Climate Change Impacts üåç
## Project Overview
Welcome to the ClimateWins project! This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for using machine learning to analyze weather data and predict climate change impacts in Europe. 

This project explores:

How machine learning can predict extreme weather events and climate conditions.  
Historical analysis of temperature extremes in Europe from 18 weather stations.  
Ethical considerations and best practices in applying AI to climate studies.  
## Key Objectives
Understand machine learning applications for weather and climate data.  
Explore supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for predictive analysis.  
Use historical weather data to identify trends and predict conditions.  
Deliver actionable insights to ClimateWins for strategic planning.  
 
## Running the Analysis
#### Supervised Learning
Outputs include:   
Trained model metrics.   
Visualizations of temperature trends.   
Predictions of future weather conditions based on historical data.   

## Key Findings
Historical Analysis: Trends of increasing temperature extremes over the past 20 years.   
Prediction Capabilities: Potential to forecast favorable/dangerous weather conditions for planning.   
Ethical Concerns: Need for transparency and bias mitigation in training AI for weather predictions.   

## Ethical Considerations   
We acknowledge the ethical implications of AI in climate studies, including:

Data privacy and accuracy.   
Transparency in model development.   
Avoiding biases in predictions.   

## Repository Structure
Data: Raw historical weather data.   
Supervised: Supervised learning model and analysis.   
Results: Plots and visualizations of findings.
